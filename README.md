*Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) refer to developmental disorders
neurological, with onset in the first three years of life, and are characterized by
difficulties in communication, social interaction, and limited and repetitive patterns
in an individual's behaviors, interests and activities. Autism
represents a very complex syndrome, in most cases of a
genetic , and because its manifestations are very varied and can differ
considerably from subject to subject, it is more appropriate to speak of "autism spectrum."
the application developed
for this thesis work for training patients with spectrum disorders
autism spectrum disorders (ASD) involves the use of the humanoid robot Pepper from SoftBank Robotics.*
